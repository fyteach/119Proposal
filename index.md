## Suggested Changes for College Algebra

- Adopt a set of **detailed learning goals** for the course.

- create a webpage with previous final exams to help students with math anxiety.

## Why Learning Goals Matter

- **Clarity for Students**  
  Students know exactly what they are expected to learn and master.

- **Consistency Across Sections**  
  Reduces variability in teaching and assessment.

- **Improved Outcomes**  
  Clear goals improve retention and performance.

---

## Current Challenges

- Key topics are covered based on the final review sheet.  
- Varied difficulty in exams and quizzes  
- Students unsure of expectations  
- Hard to measure course effectiveness  

---

## Proposed Solution - Adopt Detailed Learning Goals

- Define **specific, measurable goals** for each major topic.

- Use these goals as the foundation for:

  - Guideline of teaching content

  - Uniform final exam
  
  - Aligned (uniform) midterms, quizzes, and exercises

---

## Why It Works

- **Alignment**: Teaching, practice, and assessment all point to the same objectives and with the (almost) same level of difficulty.

- **Fairness**: Every student is evaluated on the same core competencies.

- **Flexibility**: Instructors can still choose their teaching style, examples, order of topics, and additional materials.

- **Data-Driven**: Easier to analyze which goals students struggle with and adjust instruction accordingly.

## Supporting Resource

- Iâ€™ve created a website of learning goals with practice problems and a workbook aligned with these learning goals:
  
  - Learning Goals: <https://119goals.netlify.app/>

  - Workbook: <https://ccs2025.netlify.app/>
  
- I also have a collection of exam problems in LaTeX using random numbers.
  - Question bank: <https://github.com/fyteach/LaTeX-Question-Bank>

## Next Steps

- **Discuss and refine** the proposed learning goals as a department.

- **Pilot** sections.

- **Develop**
  - uniform (final) exams based on agreed goals.
  - aligned midterms, quizzes, and exercises.
  - question bank for instructors.

- **Evaluate** student performance and instructor feedback.
